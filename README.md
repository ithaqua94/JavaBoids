# Boids

Flocking AI written in Java. The program is structured following Craig Reynold's three rules implementation and uses a custom Vector class to properly use vector mathematics. Everything is well named so the code is mostly self-explanatory, the few code comments that exist are for the parts that are not obvious.

## Installation

Just compile the Driver.java file and you are good to go. The program will run as a full screen application.
'''
javac Driver.java
'''

## Notes

The boundaries constraint is currently not implemented due to the fact that either the rule is poorly coded (likely), or the rule weights are messed up putting the whole flock in a corner.
