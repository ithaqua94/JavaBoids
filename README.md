# Boids

Flocking AI written in Java. The program is structured following Craig Reynold's three rules implementation and uses a custom Vector class to properly use vector mathematics. Written in Java and everything is properly named so that the code is pretty self-explanatory.

## Installation

Just compile the Driver.java file and you are good to go. The program will run as a full screen application.
'''
javac Driver.java
'''

## Notes

The boundaries constraint is currently not implemented due to the fact that either the rule is poorly coded (likely) or the rule weights are messed up so it just causes the whole flock to get clumped up in a corner.
